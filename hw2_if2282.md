# Problem 1

## Reading Mr. Trash Wheel Dataset:

``` r
trash_wheel = 
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N408"
    ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0)) %>%
  mutate(homes_powered = round(homes_powered, digits = 0))
```

Description: The dataset for Mr. Trashwheel contains 344 observations.
The data is collected from the years . The median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017 were 8.

## Reading Precipiation Datasets for 2018 and 2019:

``` r
precipitation_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(year = "2018")

precipitation_2019 = 
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(year = "2019")

precipitation =
  bind_rows(precipitation_2018, precipitation_2019) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```
